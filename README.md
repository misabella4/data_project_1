# Data Project 1

Original project proposal:
I am going to see if there is a correlation between the most popular artists of 2024 on a streaming app like Spotify vs how often they appear on the Billboard top 100 chart. I will use this API: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started to find an artist's popularity and see if the most popular artists appear more often on the chart. I will use a CSV file with the Billboard top 100 songs and pull the artists off that as data to compare. I can create the CSV manually in Excel using the chart I find online. As for the Spotify API, it's open source if you have an account, but I'll use cURL to make the API calls. All instructions can be found in the link above.
